h1. Grouped Property Linter for SCSS-Lint

This is a plugin linter for "SCSS-Lint":https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint that provides a saner alternative to the built-in @PropertySortOrder@ linter.

Instead of requiring properties to be arranged in a strict order, it instead allows groups of properties (eg: @top@, @right@, @bottom@ & @left@) to be defined, and then lints the order of the _groups_ in your SASS.
As long as properties are grouped correctly, the order of individual properties is unimportant.

h2. Examples

Using the default configuration:

*Bad*

<pre><code lang="css">.selector {
  padding: .625rem;

  text-decoration: underline;
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.3;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: rgba(20, 20, 20, .8);

  display: inline-block;
  background: #F00;
}</code></pre>

*Good*

<pre><code lang="css">.selector {
  display: inline-block;

  padding: .625rem;

  color: rgba(20, 20, 20, .8);
  background: #F00;

  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.3em;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: underline;
}</code></pre>

Because the order of individual properties within a group is ignored, neither of the selectors below would generate a warning.

<pre><code lang="css">.selector-one {
  display: block;

  height: 10em;
  width:  90%;
}

.selector-two {
  display: block;

  width:  90%;
  height: 10em;
}</code></pre>

h2. Usage

In order to use this linter, you’ll need to modify both your Gemfile and scss-lint configuration file (typically @.scss-lint@).

*Gemfile*

<pre><code lang="ruby">gem 'grouped_property_scss_linter', :git => 'git@github.com:jonpearse/grouped_property_scss_linter.git'</code></pre>

*SCSS-Lint configuration file*

You will need to add @grouped_property_scss_linter@ to the @plugin_gems@ variable:

<pre><code lang="yaml">plugin_gems: ['grouped_property_scss_linter']</code></pre>

h2. Configuration

When included, this linter is enabled by default, and enforces my personal coding style, which may not be entirely suitable for your needs =)

The configuration may be altered in the same way as other linters, by adding a section to your SCSS-Lint configuration file.

<pre><code lang="yaml">linters:
  GroupedPropertyOrder:
    enabled: true
    defaults:
      space_around: true
      max_no_space: 3
    groups:
      groupname:
        properties:
          - propertyone
          - property-two
          …
      another_group:
        space_around: false
        properties:
          - property
          - propertywithwildcard*
      …
</code></pre>

h3. Options

- @enabled@ _(boolean)_ := switches the module on and off
- @defaults@ _(hash)_ := default linting settings that are applied to all groups (can be overridden per-group)
- @groups@ _(hash)_ := a hash of the configured groups. The groupname should be vaguely human-readable to provide sane lint messages =)


h4. Default options

* - @space_around@ _(boolean)_ := whether to require space around individual groups (default: true)
* - @max_no_space@ _(int)_ := the maximum number of properties that can be specified in a group before space is required around it (default: 3, ignored if @space_around@ is @false@)


h3. Specifying groups

Groups are specified as a YAML hash, in the order in which they should appear in your SASS. Each group *must* have a @properties@ member, containing an array of properties that may appear in this group.

<pre><code lang="yaml">groups:
  tables:
    properties:
      - table-layout
      - border-collapse
      - empty-cells</code></pre>

Specifies a group called @tables@, which may contain @table-layout@, @border-collapse@ and @empty-cells@ properties.

h4. Wildcard properties

In cases where a number of properties may have the same prefix, wildcard properties may used instead.
Thus, the following group definitions are equivalent.

<pre><code lang="yaml">groups:
  text:
    properties:
      - font
      - font-size
      - font-family
      - font-style
  text_two:
    properties:
      - font*</code></pre>

Naturally, you might want to use this functionality carefully…

h4. Overriding defaults

In some cases, you may wish to override the default linting options. This can be done by adding the appropriate option to the group hash:

<pre><code lang="yaml">groups:
  tables:
    max_no_space: 1
    properties:
      - table-layout
      - border-collapse
      - empty-cells</code></pre>

This defines a @tables@ group as earlier, but requires a space around it at all times.

h2. Why?

I’ll write about this sometime, but for now the short version is ‘because’.
